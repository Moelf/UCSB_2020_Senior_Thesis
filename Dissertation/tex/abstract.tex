The discovery of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) 
was a major achievement of the experimental
particle physics community in the 21st century. Though a fair portion of the physics analysis
focus has shifted to Supersymmetry (SUSY) physics, the direct search of SUSY models
has yield null result so far. Meanwhile, the many properties of Higgs are still to be
measured. 

In this analysis, we present constraints on the decay width of 
Higgs boson, $\Gamma_\text{H}$, by using the on-shell and off-shell decay rates of 
Higgs to a pair of Z bosons and both Z's decay to a pair of electrons or muons.
The result represent the expected constraints using the physics
events and CMS experiment detector response simulated data via Monte Carlo methods (MC).
The data and expected results correspond to run 2018 which has an integrated 
luminosity of  \SI{59.7}{\per\femto\barn} at center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV.
