The discovery of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) 
was a major achievement of the experimental
particle physics community in the 21st century. Though a fair portion of the physics analysis
focus has shifted to Supersymmetry (SUSY) physics, the direct search of SUSY models
has yield null results so far. Meanwhile, many properties of the Higgs boson are still to be
measured. 

In this analysis, we present constraints on the total decay width of 
Higgs boson, $\Gamma_\mathrm{H}$, by using the on-shell and off-shell decay rates of 
Higgs boson to a pair of Z bosons with one Z-boson decaying into a pair of electrons or muons and the
other into neutrinos. A total
number of 2 ($ee$ or $\mu\mu$) Ã— 4 ($\njets = 0,1,2,3+$) = 8 channels are considered and used for
limits fitting.
The result represents the expected constraints using the physics
events and CMS experiment detector response simulated data via Monte Carlo methods (MC).
The data and expected results correspond to data collected in 2016, 2017, and 2018, which has an integrated luminosity of  \SI{137.15}{\per\femto\barn} at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The expected constraint
based on simulation is $\Gamma_\mathrm{H} < \SI{16.4}{\mega\electronvolt}$ 95\% CL.
