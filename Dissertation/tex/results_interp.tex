Final results of this thesis is presented. As the result acts as
`expected' limits, the ongoing work and potential interpretation are discussed.
% TODO
% 1) where it intersects -2deltaNLL=3.84
% 2) what is the value of -2deltaNLL at muoffshell=0
\section{Limits}
After running through Combined Limited tool for likelihood fitting, the final expected
limits on the decay width of Higgs $\Gamma_\mathrm{H}$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:final_fit}.
