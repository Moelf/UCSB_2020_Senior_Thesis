    The research presented in this senior thesis would not been possible if
    not for the many people's guidance, encouragement, and help. Foremost, I 
    would like to thank my research adviser Dr.\ Claudio Campagnari for his
    constant support and mentorship, both in research and my student life 
    in the past almost 3 years. He lead me into the field of High Energy
    physics and had provided personal attention to my progress along the way.
    He is also the one who suggested the research topic to me as a step up from
    what I have been doing.

    At the same time, I would also like to thank Dr.\ Ulascan Sarica, who is the 
    primary correspondent in physics analysis for this research at UCSB. It would 
    not be possible for
    me to undertake such a complex analysis if not for his dedication and careful
    teaching.

    Additionally, I would like to acknowledge the help from Nick Amin, who guided
    me personally in the summer of 2017 when I first joined the group. Nick has also
    helped me tremendously in both physics and technical issues and have provided many
    useful tools for physics and computing. In the same regard, I would like to thank 
    Bennett Marsh and Sicheng Wang for their help and guidance in the past years.
