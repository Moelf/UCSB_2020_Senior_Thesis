	abstract = {Many measurements and searches for physics beyond the standard model at the {LHC} rely on the efficient identification of heavy-flavour jets, i.e. jets originating from bottom or charm quarks. In this paper, the discriminating variables and the algorithms used for heavy-flavour jet identification during the first years of operation of the {CMS} experiment in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 {TeV}, are presented. Heavy-flavour jet identification algorithms have been improved compared to those used previously at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 {TeV}. For jets with transverse momenta in the range expected in simulated \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{t\}{\textbackslash}overline\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{t\}\}\$ events, these new developments result in an efficiency of 68\% for the correct identification of a b jet for a probability of 1\% of misidentifying a light-flavour jet. The improvement in relative efficiency at this misidentification probability is about 15\%, compared to previous {CMS} algorithms. In addition, for the first time algorithms have been developed to identify jets containing two b hadrons in Lorentz-boosted event topologies, as well as to tag c jets. The large data sample recorded in 2016 at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 {TeV} has also allowed the development of new methods to measure the efficiency and misidentification probability of heavy-flavour jet identification algorithms. The heavy-flavour jet identification efficiency is measured with a precision of a few per cent at moderate jet transverse momenta (between 30 and 300 {GeV}) and about 5\% at the highest jet transverse momenta (between 500 and 1000 {GeV}).},

	abstract = {We present a new set of parton distributions, {NNPDF}3.1, which updates {NNPDF}3.0, the first global set of {PDFs} determined using a methodology validated by a closure test. The update is motivated by recent progress in methodology and available data, and involves both. On the methodological side, we now parametrize and determine the charm {PDF} alongside the light quarks and gluon ones, thereby increasing from seven to eight the number of independent {PDFs}. On the data side, we now include the D0 electron and muon W asymmetries from the final Tevatron dataset, the complete {LHCb} measurements of W and Z production in the forward region at 7 and 8 {TeV}, and new {ATLAS} and {CMS} measurements of inclusive jet and electroweak boson production. We also include for the first time top-quark pair differential distributions and the transverse momentum of the Z bosons from {ATLAS} and {CMS}. We investigate the impact of parametrizing charm and provide evidence that the accuracy and stability of the {PDFs} are thereby improved. We study the impact of the new data by producing a variety of determinations based on reduced datasets. We find that both improvements have a significant impact on the {PDFs}, with some substantial reductions in uncertainties, but with the new {PDFs} generally in agreement with the previous set at the one sigma level. The most significant changes are seen in the light-quark flavor separation, and in increased precision in the determination of the gluon. We explore the implications of {NNPDF}3.1 for {LHC} phenomenology at Run {II}, compare with recent {LHC} measurements at 13 {TeV}, provide updated predictions for Higgs production cross-sections and discuss the strangeness and charm content of the proton in light of our improved dataset and methodology.

A fully-fledged {PF} reconstruction algorithm tuned to the {CMS} detector was therefore developed and has been consistently used in physics analyses for the first time at a hadron collider. For each collision, the comprehensive list of final-state particles identified and reconstructed by the algorithm provides a global event description that leads to unprecedented {CMS} performance for jet and hadronic tau decay reconstruction, missing transverse momentum determination, and electron and muon identification. This approach also allows particles from pileup interactions to be identified and enables efficient pileup mitigation methods. The data collected by {CMS} at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 {TeV} show excellent agreement with the simulation and confirm the superior {PF} performance at least up to an average of 20 pileup interactions.},

This process is mediated by loops of quarks and we provide first full analytic results for helicity amplitudes that account for both the effects of the quark mass in the loop and off-shell vector bosons. The analytic results have been implemented in the Monte Carlo program {MCFM} and are both fast, and numerically stable in the region of low Z transverse momentum. We use our results to study the interference between Higgs-mediated and continuum production of four-lepton final states, which is necessary in order to obtain accurate theoretical predictions outside the Higgs resonance region. We have confirmed and extended a recent analysis of Caola and Melnikov that proposes to use a measurement of the off-shell region to constrain the total width of the Higgs boson. Using a simple cut-and-count method, existing {LHC} data should bound the width at the level of 25–45 times the Standard Model expectation. We investigate the power of using a matrix element method to construct a kinematic discriminant to sharpen the constraint. In our analysis the bound on the Higgs width is improved by a factor of about 1.6 using a simple cut on the {MEM} discriminant, compared to an invariant mass cut m4l{\textgreater} 300 {GeV}.},

We use minimum-bias, Drell–Yan, and underlying-event data from the {LHC} to constrain the initial-state-radiation and multi-parton-interaction parameters, combined with data from {SPS} and the Tevatron to constrain the energy scaling. Several distributions show significant improvements with respect to the current defaults, for both \$\$ee\$\$eeand \$\$pp\$\$ppcollisions, though we emphasize that interesting discrepancies remain in particular for strange particles and baryons. The updated parameters are available as an option starting from {PYTHIA} 8.185, by setting Tune:ee = 7 and Tune:pp = 14.},

We present a computer program, {MadGraph}5 {aMC}@{NLO}, capable of handling all these computations — parton-level fixed order, shower-matched, merged — in a unified framework whose defining features are flexibility, high level of parallelisation, and human intervention limited to input physics quantities. We demonstrate the potential of the program by presenting selected phenomenological applications relevant to the {LHC} and to a 1-{TeV} e+e− collider. While next-to-leading order results are restricted to {QCD} corrections to {SM} processes in the first public version, we show that from the user viewpoint no changes have to be expected in the case of corrections due to any given renormalisable Lagrangian, and that the implementation of these are well under way.},

This process occurs both through the production and decay of the Higgs boson, and through continuum production where the Z boson couples to a loop of massless quarks or to a massive quark. We calculate the interference of the two processes and its contribution to the cross section up to and including order O(αs3). The two-loop contributions to the amplitude are all known analytically, except for the continuum production through loops of top quarks of mass m. The latter contribution is important for the invariant mass of the two Z bosons, (as measured by the mass of their leptonic decay products, m4l), in a regime where m4l≥ 2m because of the contributions of longitudinal bosons. We examine all the contributions to the virtual amplitude involving top quarks, as expansions about the heavy top quark limit combined with a conformal mapping and Padé approximants. Comparison with the analytic results, where known, allows us to assess the validity of the heavy quark expansion, and it extensions. We give results for the {NLO} corrections to this interference, including both real and virtual radiation.},

We consider both the prompt production process gg → V V and the production mediated by an exchange of an s-channel Higgs boson, gg → H∗ → V V . We include final states with both on- and off-shell vector bosons with leptonic decays. The gluonic production of vector bosons is a loop-induced process, including both massless and massive quarks in the loop. For gg → {ZZ} production, we obtain the {NLO} {QCD} corrections to the massive loops through an expansion around the heavy top limit. This approximation is valid below the top production threshold, giving a broad range of invariant masses between the Higgs production and the top production thresholds in which our results are valid. We explore the {NLO} {QCD} effects in gg → {ZZ} focusing, in particular, on the interference between prompt and Higgs-mediated processes. We find that the {QCD} corrections to the interference are large and similar in size to the corrections to both the signal and the background processes. At the same time, we observe that corrections to the interference change rapidly with the four-lepton invariant mass in the region around the {ZZ} production threshold. We also study the interference effects in gg → W +W − production where, due to technical limitations, we only consider contributions of massless loops. We find that the {QCD} corrections to the interference in this case are somewhat larger than those for either the signal or the background.},

The gg→{ZZ} annihilation is a loop-induced process that receives the dominant contribution from loops of five light quarks, that are included in our computation in the massless approximation.

	abstract = {Combined {ATLAS} and {CMS} measurements of the Higgs boson production and decay rates, as well as constraints on its couplings to vector bosons and fermions, are presented. The combination is based on the analysis of five production processes, namely gluon fusion, vector boson fusion, and associated production with a \$W\$ or a \$Z\$ boson or a pair of top quarks, and of the six decay modes \$H {\textbackslash}to {ZZ}, {WW}\$, \${\textbackslash}gamma{\textbackslash}gamma, {\textbackslash}tau{\textbackslash}tau, bb\$, and \${\textbackslash}mu{\textbackslash}mu\$. All results are reported assuming a value of 125.09 {GeV} for the Higgs boson mass, the result of the combined measurement by the {ATLAS} and {CMS} experiments. The analysis uses the {CERN} {LHC} proton--proton collision data recorded by the {ATLAS} and {CMS} experiments in 2011 and 2012, corresponding to integrated luminosities per experiment of approximately 5 fb\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ at \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{s\}=7\$ {TeV} and 20 fb\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ at \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{s\} = 8\$ {TeV}. The Higgs boson production and decay rates measured by the two experiments are combined within the context of three generic parameterisations: two based on cross sections and branching fractions, and one on ratios of coupling modifiers. Several interpretations of the measurements with more model-dependent parameterisations are also given. The combined signal yield relative to the Standard Model prediction is measured to be 1.09 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.11. The combined measurements lead to observed significances for the vector boson fusion production process and for the \$H {\textbackslash}to {\textbackslash}tau{\textbackslash}tau\$ decay of \$5.4\$ and \$5.5\$ standard deviations, respectively. The data are consistent with the Standard Model predictions for all parameterisations considered.},
