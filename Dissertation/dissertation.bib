	abstract = {Many measurements and searches for physics beyond the standard model at the {LHC} rely on the efficient identification of heavy-flavour jets, i.e. jets originating from bottom or charm quarks. In this paper, the discriminating variables and the algorithms used for heavy-flavour jet identification during the first years of operation of the {CMS} experiment in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 {TeV}, are presented. Heavy-flavour jet identification algorithms have been improved compared to those used previously at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 {TeV}. For jets with transverse momenta in the range expected in simulated \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{t\}{\textbackslash}overline\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{t\}\}\$ events, these new developments result in an efficiency of 68\% for the correct identification of a b jet for a probability of 1\% of misidentifying a light-flavour jet. The improvement in relative efficiency at this misidentification probability is about 15\%, compared to previous {CMS} algorithms. In addition, for the first time algorithms have been developed to identify jets containing two b hadrons in Lorentz-boosted event topologies, as well as to tag c jets. The large data sample recorded in 2016 at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 {TeV} has also allowed the development of new methods to measure the efficiency and misidentification probability of heavy-flavour jet identification algorithms. The heavy-flavour jet identification efficiency is measured with a precision of a few per cent at moderate jet transverse momenta (between 30 and 300 {GeV}) and about 5\% at the highest jet transverse momenta (between 500 and 1000 {GeV}).},

A fully-fledged {PF} reconstruction algorithm tuned to the {CMS} detector was therefore developed and has been consistently used in physics analyses for the first time at a hadron collider. For each collision, the comprehensive list of final-state particles identified and reconstructed by the algorithm provides a global event description that leads to unprecedented {CMS} performance for jet and hadronic tau decay reconstruction, missing transverse momentum determination, and electron and muon identification. This approach also allows particles from pileup interactions to be identified and enables efficient pileup mitigation methods. The data collected by {CMS} at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 {TeV} show excellent agreement with the simulation and confirm the superior {PF} performance at least up to an average of 20 pileup interactions.},

This process is mediated by loops of quarks and we provide first full analytic results for helicity amplitudes that account for both the effects of the quark mass in the loop and off-shell vector bosons. The analytic results have been implemented in the Monte Carlo program {MCFM} and are both fast, and numerically stable in the region of low Z transverse momentum. We use our results to study the interference between Higgs-mediated and continuum production of four-lepton final states, which is necessary in order to obtain accurate theoretical predictions outside the Higgs resonance region. We have confirmed and extended a recent analysis of Caola and Melnikov that proposes to use a measurement of the off-shell region to constrain the total width of the Higgs boson. Using a simple cut-and-count method, existing {LHC} data should bound the width at the level of 25–45 times the Standard Model expectation. We investigate the power of using a matrix element method to construct a kinematic discriminant to sharpen the constraint. In our analysis the bound on the Higgs width is improved by a factor of about 1.6 using a simple cut on the {MEM} discriminant, compared to an invariant mass cut m4l{\textgreater} 300 {GeV}.},

For hadron collisions, we combine the updated fragmentation parameters with the new {NNPDF}2.3 {LO} {PDF} set. We use minimum-bias, Drell–Yan, and underlying-event data from the {LHC} to constrain the initial-state-radiation and multi-parton-interaction parameters, combined with data from {SPS} and the Tevatron to constrain the energy scaling. Several distributions show significant improvements with respect to the current defaults, for both \$\$ee\$\$eeand \$\$pp\$\$ppcollisions, though we emphasize that interesting discrepancies remain in particular for strange particles and baryons. The updated parameters are available as an option starting from {PYTHIA} 8.185, by setting Tune:ee = 7 and Tune:pp = 14.},

	abstract = {We discuss the theoretical bases that underpin the automation of the computations of tree-level and next-to-leading order cross sections, of their matching to parton shower simulations, and of the merging of matched samples that differ by light-parton multiplicities. We present a computer program, {MadGraph}5 {aMC}@{NLO}, capable of handling all these computations — parton-level fixed order, shower-matched, merged — in a unified framework whose defining features are flexibility, high level of parallelisation, and human intervention limited to input physics quantities. We demonstrate the potential of the program by presenting selected phenomenological applications relevant to the {LHC} and to a 1-{TeV} e+e− collider. While next-to-leading order results are restricted to {QCD} corrections to {SM} processes in the first public version, we show that from the user viewpoint no changes have to be expected in the case of corrections due to any given renormalisable Lagrangian, and that the implementation of these are well under way.},

	abstract = {Studies of on-shell and off-shell Higgs boson production in the four-lepton final state are presented, using data from the {CMS} experiment at the {LHC} that correspond to an integrated luminosity of 80.2 fb\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ at a center-of-mass energy of 13 {TeV}. Joint constraints are set on the Higgs boson total width and parameters that express its anomalous couplings to two electroweak vector bosons. These results are combined with those obtained from the data collected at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 {TeV}, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 5.1 and 19.7 fb\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, respectively. Kinematic information from the decay particles and the associated jets are combined using matrix element techniques to identify the production mechanism and to increase sensitivity to the Higgs boson couplings in both production and decay. The constraints on anomalous {HVV} couplings are found to be consistent with the standard model expectation in both the on-shell and off-shell regions. Under the assumption of a coupling structure similar to that in the standard model, the Higgs boson width is constrained to be 3.2 \${\textasciicircum}\{+2.8\}\_\{-2.2\}\$ {MeV} while the expected constraint based on simulation is 4.1 \${\textasciicircum}\{+5.0\}\_\{-4.0\}\$ {MeV}. The constraints on the width remain similar with the inclusion of the tested anomalous {HVV} interactions.},

	abstract = {Properties of the Higgs (H) boson are measured in the \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{H\}{\textbackslash}rightarrow\{{\textbackslash}rm Z\}\{{\textbackslash}rm Z\}{\textbackslash}rightarrow4{\textbackslash}ell\$ (\${\textbackslash}ell=\{{\textbackslash}rm e\},{\textbackslash}mu\$) decay channel. The full data sample of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of \$13{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{TeV}\}\$ is used, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of \$137.1{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{fb\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ recorded in 2016, 2017, and 2018 by the {CMS} detector at the {LHC}. The signal-strength modifier \${\textbackslash}mu\$, defined as the ratio of the H boson rate in the \$4{\textbackslash}ell\$ channel to the Standard Model ({SM}) expectation, is measured to be \${\textbackslash}mu=0.94{\textasciicircum}\{+0.07\}\_\{-0.07\}(\{{\textbackslash}rm stat.\}) {\textasciicircum}\{+0.08\}\_\{-0.07\}(\{{\textbackslash}rm syst.\})\$ with the H boson mass profiled in the fit. The signal-strength modifiers for different H boson production modes are also constrained. Measurements of the simplified template cross sections, designed to quantify the different H boson production processes in specific regions of phase space, are reported. The cross section for the production of the \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{H\}{\textbackslash}rightarrow4{\textbackslash}ell\$ in a fiducial region closely matching the experimental selection of the leptons is measured to be \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm fid.\}\}=2.73{\textasciicircum}\{+0.23\}\_\{-0.22\}(\{{\textbackslash}rm stat.\}){\textasciicircum}\{+0.24\}\_\{-0.19\}(\{{\textbackslash}rm syst.\}){\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm fb\}\$ at \$m\_\{{\textbackslash}rm H\} = 125.09{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{GeV}\}\$, compared to a {SM} prediction of \$2.76 {\textbackslash}pm 0.14{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{fb\}\$. Differential cross sections as a function of the \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}rm T\}\$ and rapidity of the H boson, the number of associated jets, and the \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}rm T\}\$ of the leading associated jet are determined. All results are found to be compatible with the {SM} predictions, within the measurements precision.},
